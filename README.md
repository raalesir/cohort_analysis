# Cohort Analysis and Statistical Hypothesis Testing

This small project is about
cohort analysis and statistical hypothesis testing.
               
A data scientist observes cohorts behaviour over time periods,
and whitnesses some interesting features, distinguishing one
cohort from the others.

The hypothesis (null-hypothesis) of the possible reason is
being formed.

Seeking to find a statistical basis for judging the hypothesis,
data scientist tries to establish the statistics, which could
explain the observed features of the cohort in focus.</p>
Established the statistics, data scientist tests the
features
against the statistics, setting some pi-value in beforehand.

In this particular study we were interested in the following:
whether it is possible to explan the almost doubled sugar
consumption for some African countries during 1986-2004, based on
the increase of the GDP  observed in those countries during the same
period.
